/**
 * Section Data Store
 *
 * Manages section data with localStorage persistence for the CMS.
 * This module provides a centralized way to read/write section configurations
 * that can be used by both the admin dashboard and the public-facing pages.
 *
 * CRITICAL SYSTEM INVARIANT:
 * =========================
 * ALL sections (except hero-carousel and banner) MUST have fullScreen: true
 * This is NON-NEGOTIABLE and enforced automatically:
 * - Ensures every section fills viewport (min-height: 100vh)
 * - Enables proper scroll-snap behavior (sections never skipped)
 * - Prevents content from being overlooked during scrolling
 * - Guarantees consistent user experience across all sections
 *
 * This invariant is enforced in:
 * - getSections() - Reads and auto-corrects stored data
 * - saveSections() - Validates and corrects before saving
 * - updateSection() - Prevents fullScreen from being disabled
 * - addSection() - Sets fullScreen=true for new sections
 *
 * TODO: Replace localStorage with backend API calls when available
 * API Endpoints to implement:
 * - GET /api/pages/:slug - Fetch page with all sections
 * - PUT /api/pages/:slug - Update entire page
 * - PATCH /api/sections/:id - Update single section
 * - DELETE /api/sections/:id - Delete section
